What is Friendshipr?
--------------------

Friendshipr calculates and displays your friendship ranking. You know how you rank, you know who are your highest ranking friends, you know who has the highest ranking, and you can search for the rankings of people you know.

Your friendshp ranking is the sum of the friendship ranking of your friends on Facebook. Their friendship ranking is in turn the sum of the friendship ranking of their friends, and so on. Thus, the friendship ranking is defined recursively on the graph of friendships on Facebook. This solved, and gives an ranking of all the people who have added this application.

Think of it like Google pagerank, except that it is for the friendships on Facebook. People-rank.

There are thus two ways to increase your friendship ranking - either by befriending people with high ranks; or making sure this application is added to your friends.
